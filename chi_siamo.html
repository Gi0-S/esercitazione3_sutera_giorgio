                <p>Camilo Huinca's work is rich with colour, content and a brightly illustrated narrative that speaks for itself. 
                    Born and raised in Santiago in Chile, Camilo has divided his career between graphic design and painting. 
                    Working independently has allowed Camilo to “develop (his) own style, having a main focus on the use of curiosity,” he explains. 
                    In 2014 Camilo set up Perfe Studio where he concentrates on graphic design projects in “a more commercial way”.</p>
